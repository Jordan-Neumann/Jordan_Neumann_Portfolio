# Jordan Neumann Project Porfolio 

## Classification

### Rush - Progressive Rock Music 
* Rush is a classic rock band that has recorded 165 original songs on 19 studio albums. 
* Utilized Spotify's API to extract data about all of the band's music.
* Developed a variety of random forest models to classify whether individual tracks were from the band's progressive rock era (1974 - 1981).
* View the Kaggle notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jordankeith/rush-progressive-rock-era).

## Regression

### Kaggle Competition - Tabular Playground Series - January
* The task is to predict a bimodal continuous target variable with 14 bimodal or multimodal continuous independent variables.
* Submissions are evaluated on the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE). 
* Developed a voting regressor that is comprised of XGBoost and Light XGBoost regressors to minimize the RMSE.
* Trained the models in the cloud by creating an Amazon Sagemaker notebook instance.

## Time Series

### Medical Marijuana Sales Forecasting
* The goal of this project is to forecast California's medical marijuana sales for the next 12 months.
* Adjusted sales for inflation using Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers.
* Visualized the data by creating time, seasonal, and autocorrelation plots.
* Created four preliminary models - mean, naive (random walk), random walk with drift, and seasonal naive
* Next Steps - Exlore decomposition, stationarity
* Next Next Steps - Forecast using exponential smoothing (ETS), ARIMA, and Seasonal ARIMA models

## Visualization 

### Police Shootings
* The phenomenon of police violence has been at or near the forefront of our public conversation for several years.
* Built an interactive dashboard in Tableau to explore data on fatal police shootings in the United States from 2015 through 2020.
* Next Steps - Add additional graphics to demonstrate shootings relative to each race's population, number of police encounters, and contributions to violent crime. 
* View the visualization [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jordan3434#!/vizhome/FatalPoliceShootings2015-2020_16098865748980/Dashboard). 
* View the data [here](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings).


### Baby Name Popularity
* Built an interactive application with RShiny to explore the popularity of baby names in New Zealand from 1954 through 2018.
* View the live application [here](https://jordan-neumann-1.shinyapps.io/rshiny/?_ga=2.223995675.1463876037.1609631665-1561344089.1609631665).

## Miscellaneous

### PDF Splitter
* Created a pdf splitter to assist with a current project that requires me to extract table data from specific pages of a large PDF document.
* Next steps - Connect to Amazon Textract, an AWS service, to extract the table data.
