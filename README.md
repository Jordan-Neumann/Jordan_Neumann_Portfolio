# Jordan Neumann Project Porfolio 

## Classification

### Rush - Progressive Rock Music 
* Rush is a classic rock band that has recorded 165 original songs on 19 studio albums. 
* I still remember the first time my dad played a Rush CD for me in his car.  Yep, a CD! (This was roughly 20 years ago)
* I used Spotify's API to extract data about all of the band's music.
* I developed a variety of random forest models to classify whether individual tracks were from the band's progressive rock era (1974 - 1981).
* View the Kaggle notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jordankeith/rush-progressive-rock-era).

## Regression

### Kaggle Competition - Tabular Playground Series - January
* In this competition, we are given 14 independent continuous variables to predict 1 continuous target variable.
* I utilized a voting regressor that is comprised of XGBoost and Light XGBoost regressors to minimize RMSE.
* I plan to create an AWS EC2 instance (providing me with more computing power) to further tune the models' hyperparameters.
* I am currently in the top 50% of all submissions.

## Visualization 

### Police Shootings
* The phenomenon of police violence has been at or near the forefront of our public conversation for several years.
* This interactive dashboard was built in Tableau to explore data on fatal police shootings in the United States from 2015 through 2020.
* I plan to add additional graphics that demonstrate shootings relative to each race's population, number of police encounters, and contributions to violent crime. 
* View the visualization [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jordan3434#!/vizhome/FatalPoliceShootings2015-2020_16098865748980/Dashboard).

### Baby Name Popularity
* â€œWhat's in a name?"  I'm not sure, but it is rumored that Shakespeare almost used Jordan instead of Romeo.
* This interactive application was built with RShiny to explore the popularity of baby names in New Zealand from 1954 through 2018.
* View the live application [here](https://jordan-neumann-1.shinyapps.io/rshiny/?_ga=2.223995675.1463876037.1609631665-1561344089.1609631665).

## Miscellaneous

### PDF Splitter
* I built this splitter to assist with a current project that requires me to extract table data from certain pages of a large PDF document.
* I will add to this project by connecting it to Amazon Textract, an AWS service, to extract the table data.
* View a demonstation of the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C38ecJLSb8).
