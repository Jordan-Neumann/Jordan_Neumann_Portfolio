## Classification

### Rush - Progressive Rock Music 
* Rush is a classic rock band that has recorded 165 original songs on 19 studio albums.
* The bands progressive rock era spanned from 1974 to 1981.
* I used Spotify's API to extract data about all of the band's music.
* I developed a variety of random forest models to classify whether individual tracks were from the band's progressive rock era.

## Visualization 

### Police Shootings
* Built an interactive dashboard in Tableau to explore police shooting data from 2015 through 2020.
* View the visualization [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jordan3434#!/vizhome/FatalPoliceShootings2015-2020_16098865748980/Dashboard).  
* View the data [here](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings).
* I plan to add additional graphics that analyse shootings as a percent of population, police encounters, and contributions to violent crime. 

### Baby Name Popularity
* Built an interactive application with RShiny to explore the popularity of baby names in New Zealand from 1954 though 2018.
* View the live application [here](https://jordan-neumann-1.shinyapps.io/rshiny/?_ga=2.223995675.1463876037.1609631665-1561344089.1609631665).

## Miscellaneous

### PDF Splitter
* I built this splitter to assist with a current project that requires me to extract table data from certain pages of a large PDF document.
* I will add to this project by connecting it to Amazon Textract, an AWS service, to extract the table data.
* View a demonstation of the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C38ecJLSb8).
