## Regression

### Kaggle Competition - Tabular Playground Series - January
* The task is to predict a bimodal continuous target variable with 14 bimodal or multimodal continuous independent variables.
* Submissions are evaluated on the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE). 
* Developed a voting regressor that is comprised of XGBoost and Light XGBoost regressors to minimize the RMSE.

## Time Series

### Medical Marijuana Sales Forecasting
* The goal of this project is to forecast Colorado's medical marijuana sales through November 2021
* Adjusted sales for inflation using Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers
* Visualized the data by creating time, seasonal, and autocorrelation plots
* Forecasted data using average, naive, drift, seasonal naive, ETS, and Seasonal ARIMA models.

## Visualization 

### Police Shootings
* The phenomenon of police violence has been at or near the forefront of our public conversation for several years.
* Built an interactive dashboard in Tableau to explore data on fatal police shootings in the United States from 2015 through 2020.
* Next Steps - Add additional graphics to demonstrate shootings relative to each race's population, number of police encounters, and contributions to violent crime.
